            <p>I created this lovely image when I followed my first <a

                    tutorial series</a> by Blender Guru. This was my take on his final product - nothing much of my own
                creativity, but this was my introduction to this art form.</p>

            <p>This is the first piece I created on my own. What is it? Perhaps I know... but perhaps I do not. This
                angle was found through messing around in my workspace; I discovered an
                entirely different camera setup that makes this shot possible (a perspective that is impossible in
                reality).<br><br>This was originally a bland take on the close-up donut project. However, as I
                found the aforementioned camera angle, the composition of the piece changed drastically; the focus
                shifted toward a larger view showing all the involved components in the shot rather than hiding
                lights and background objects... not that there were any of those.</p>

            <p>My Hotel Arpoador project is inspired by a showcase featured in
                <i>Interior Design</i> magazine. It is located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This project is only a
                recreation of a view into a single room; the external architecture may be a piece for another day
                down the road.<br><br>I learned a lot about composition, lighting, and some intricacies of modeling
                and materials while working on this. The final product is a result of some drastic forced
                perspective; the mirror and its respective wall are enlarged to ridiculous proportions that the
                audience would otherwise fail to notice. <br><br> I plan on returning to this eventually in order to
                fix up the blanket and add some shelves that are absent in my reproduction of the original photo.
                For now, this is satisfactory.</p>
